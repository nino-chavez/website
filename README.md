# Nino Chavez Portfolio: SvelteKit Edition

A high-performance personal portfolio website built with SvelteKit, demonstrating production-grade web development through AI-assisted methodology and modern web technologies.

## About This Project

Two decades architecting Fortune 500 commerce platforms—where downtime costs millions and "good enough" fails. This SvelteKit portfolio showcases personal projects and technical capabilities through a performant, accessible, and visually compelling interface.

This site demonstrates **modern web development best practices** through real implementations of performance optimization, accessibility compliance, and user experience design.

## Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Architecture

**This portfolio serves as a working proof-of-concept for Answer Engine Optimization** - the practice of structuring content so AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) can definitively answer queries about entities, products, and services.

### The Strategic Value

When a CTO asks ChatGPT "Who should I hire for SAP Commerce Cloud architecture?" or a tournament director searches "Chicago action sports photographer," this site is architecturally designed to be the answer AI models surface.

**This isn't just a portfolio - it's a case study for enterprise clients.**

### AEO Implementation

**Machine-Readable APIs:**
- `/api/person.json` - Canonical entity data (Who is Nino Chavez?)
- `/api/expertise.json` - Structured capabilities (What does he specialize in?)
- `/api/experience.json` - Work history timeline (Where has he worked?)
- `/api/contact.json` - Contact information (How do I reach him?)

**Schema.org JSON-LD:**
- Embedded `Person` schema in homepage `<head>`
- Embedded `WebSite` schema for search action
- Comprehensive structured data for Knowledge Panel eligibility

**Strategic `robots.txt`:**
- **Allows** AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Google-Extended) to index brand content
- **Allows** machine-readable APIs for entity recognition
- **Blocks** detailed implementation methodologies to protect IP
- Demonstrates data sovereignty strategy for Fortune 500 consulting

### The Sales Conversation

```bash
curl https://ninochavez.co/api/person.json
```

Returns perfectly structured JSON-LD that any AI can consume to answer "Who is Nino Chavez?"

**"This is how you win in the AI-native web. I can architect this for your entire product catalog."**

See [AEO Architecture Documentation](./docs/AEO-ARCHITECTURE.md) for full technical specification.

### Photography-Inspired Navigation

The UI follows a camera-inspired workflow with sections representing the photography process:

1. **Hero** (Capture) - Camera viewfinder interface with dynamic backgrounds
2. **Focus** - Professional background and core expertise
3. **Frame** - Personal project showcase
4. **Exposure** - Technical insights and thought leadership
5. **Gallery** - Action sports photography portfolio
6. **Portfolio** - Professional connection and contact

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes

1. Review existing component patterns in `src/lib/components/`
2. Check `types.ts` for type definitions
3. Follow Svelte conventions (reactive statements, stores, actions)
4. Consider accessibility and performance implications

### Implementation Standards

- **Component Style** - Use `<script>`, `<markup>`, `<style>` order
- **Naming Conventions** - PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Type Safety** - Use JSDoc or TypeScript for complex types
- **Accessibility** - Include ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
- **Performance** - Lazy-load non-critical components

### Testing Strategy

- **E2E Tests** - Playwright tests for user flows
- **Accessibility Tests** - axe-core automated scans
- **Visual Regression** - Snapshot comparisons for UI consistency
- **Performance Tests** - Lighthouse audits in CI/CD

## AI-Assisted Development

This project demonstrates **AI-first development methodology** with comprehensive documentation of the approach:

### Development Principles

1. **Specification-Driven** - All features begin with clear requirements
2. **Incremental Implementation** - Build in phases with continuous validation
3. **Automated Quality** - CI/CD gates for performance and accessibility
4. **Living Documentation** - Self-updating technical specifications

### AI Collaboration Tools

- **Claude Code** - Primary development assistant for architecture and implementation
- **GitHub Copilot** - Real-time code completion and suggestions
- **Cursor AI** - Intelligent refactoring and code navigation

### Quality Standards

This codebase maintains enterprise-grade quality through:

- **Automated Audits** - Performance, accessibility, and best practices
- **Visual Regression** - Prevent unintended UI changes
- **Type Safety** - JSDoc annotations for editor intelligence
- **Code Standards** - Consistent formatting and conventions

## Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel with the following configuration:

- **Adapter** - `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel` for serverless deployment
- **Static Assets** - CDN-optimized with long-lived caching
- **Build Output** - Pre-rendered pages with hybrid SSR/CSR
- **Environment** - Node.js 18+ runtime
