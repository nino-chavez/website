### 2. Domain Evaluation Framework

Five critical filters applied to all domain candidates:

#### **Filter 1: Cognitive Load Test**
- Can someone hear it once and type it correctly?
- Does it require spelling or explanation?
- Pass criteria: ≤15 characters, obvious spelling, no hyphens/numbers

#### **Filter 2: Radio Test**
- Can you say it over a phone call without confusion?
- Does the listener need you to repeat or spell it?

#### **Filter 3: Subdomain Compatibility Test**
- Does the domain create semantic conflicts with common subdomains?
- Test cases: `blog.*`, `gallery.*`, `portfolio.*`, `cv.*`

#### **Filter 4: Email Deliverability & Credibility**
- Is the TLD trusted by corporate spam filters?

## Research Findings

### Domain Extension Research

#### **.com Domain Analysis**
**Status:** Gold standard for credibility and trust
**Research findings:**
- Universal recognition and muscle-memory default
- Highest trust factor for enterprise/corporate audiences
- Primary challenge: Most desirable .com domains unavailable

**Tested variants:**
- `ninochavez.com` - ❌ Unavailable
- `nchavez.com` - ❌ Unavailable
- `ninoworks.com` - ❌ Unavailable
- `ninobuilds.com` - ✅ Available, but "builds" verb limits scope
- `ninoframes.com` - ✅ Available, but photography metaphor confuses enterprise audience

#### **.io Domain Analysis**
**Status:** Acceptable for tech professionals, narrow perception
**Research findings:**
- Popular in startup/developer circles
- Signals "tech startup" more than "seasoned enterprise architect"
- For someone with 25 years experience and $25M projects, .io may underposition

**Market perception:**
- Widely understood in tech industry
- Safe fallback option
- No email deliverability issues
- May signal "too startup-y" for Fortune 500 consulting

**Tested variant:**
- `ninochavez.io` - ✅ Available, acceptable fallback

#### **.xyz Domain Analysis**
**Status:** ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED - High spam reputation
**Critical findings from research:**

**Email Deliverability Crisis:**
- Corporate spam filters actively block .xyz domains
- Email open rates: 70% with .xyz vs 86% with .com (23% performance loss)
- Some enterprises blacklist entire .xyz TLD

**Source:** Multiple case studies documented significant business impact:
> "After switching from .xyz to .com, initial email open rates rose from 70% to 86%, second email open rates rose from 50% to 72%, and overall meeting conversions rose from 0.1% to 3%."

**Root cause:**
- .xyz offered "unlimited penny registrations" that attracted spammers
- Extension heavily associated with spam/scam sites
- Requires constant explanation: "Yes, it's a real domain"

**Verdict:** Unacceptable risk when emailing C-suite executives at Fortune 500 companies.

#### **.co Domain Analysis**
**Status:** Acceptable .com alternative, global adoption
**Research findings:**
- Originally Colombia's country TLD, now used globally
- Widely accepted in tech and professional circles
- Used by successful companies (Angel.co, Path.co)

**Tradeoff:**
- Some users will type .com by default (muscle memory)
- May require occasional correction

**Tested variant:**
- `ninochavez.co` - ✅ Available, strong fallback option

#### **.me Domain Analysis**
**Status:** Niche acceptance, personal branding focus
**Research findings:**
- Effective for individuals in creative, digital, and service-based industries
- Shorter and more intuitive than dashed .com alternatives
- Better for word-of-mouth, podcast mentions, QR campaigns

**Limitations:**
- Not commonly seen in enterprise consulting circles
- May appear too casual for Fortune 500 client base
- User reported: "I don't see .me used by a lot of people"

**Verdict:** Not aligned with primary enterprise audience expectations.

#### **.design Domain Analysis**
**Status:** Niche creative TLD, not widely adopted
**Research findings:**
- Makes it clear you're a designer/creative from domain alone
- Used by design agencies, architects, creative professionals
- Strong for portfolios in creative fields

**Limitations:**
- Not common in enterprise architecture consulting
- May confuse enterprise audience: "Is this a design agency?"
- User reported: ".design is also not common to me"

**Verdict:** Too niche, favors photography audience over primary enterprise audience.

#### **.dev Domain Analysis**
**Status:** Developer-focused, too narrow
**Research findings:**
- Familiar in software development circles
- Signals "software developer" specifically

**Limitations:**
- User concern: "seems more focused on developers than full rounded people like me"
- Doesn't communicate strategic advisory, photography, or multi-disciplinary positioning

**Verdict:** Too narrow, boxes identity into single discipline.

#### **.studio Domain Analysis**
**Status:** Creative studio positioning, dual-meaning potential
**Research findings:**
- Common for: Design agencies, architecture firms, creative studios, photo studios
- "Studio" semantically works for both architecture practice AND photography studio

**Tradeoff:**
- Implies physical location or agency (when consultant is independent)
- May feel "too creative" for enterprise architecture consulting

**Tested variants:**
- `chavez.studio` - ❌ Unavailable
- `ninochavez.studio` - ✅ Available

**Subdomain concern:**
- `gallery.ninochavez.studio` reads as "gallery at Nino Chavez studio" (slight redundancy)
- `portfolio.ninochavez.studio` has same redundancy issue

#### **.pro Domain Analysis**
**Status:** ✅ RECOMMENDED - Professional credibility across all fields
**Research findings:**
- Reserved for verified professionals (doctors, lawyers, consultants)
- Signals professional-grade credibility
- Works across ALL disciplines without limiting scope

**Key advantages:**
- "Pro" doesn't imply physical location
- Doesn't favor creative over technical (or vice versa)
- Clean subdomain semantics: `gallery.ninochavez.pro`, `cv.ninochavez.pro`

**Potential limitation:**
- Less common than .com/.io, some users may be unfamiliar

**Tested variant:**
- `ninochavez.pro` - ✅ Available

---

## Recommendation Rationale

### Primary Recommendation: `ninochavez.pro`

#### Strengths:
1. **Dual-audience compatibility:** "Pro" signals professional grade in both enterprise consulting AND photography without favoring either
2. **Zero cognitive load:** Your actual name + universally understood "professional" signal
3. **Email credibility:** `nino@ninochavez.pro` projects professional authority
4. **Subdomain architecture:** All subdomains semantically clean without redundancy
5. **Maximum flexibility:** Can never outgrow your own name + professional signal
6. **No physical location implication:** Works for remote consulting and on-location photography
7. **Career evolution proof:** If you pivot to coaching, advisory, or other disciplines, domain still works

#### Considerations:
- `.pro` extension less common than `.com` (but more credible than `.io`, `.xyz`, etc.)
- Some users may be unfamiliar with `.pro` TLD
- Mitigated by: Direct links from business cards, email signatures, social media

#### Use Cases:
- **Enterprise consulting:** CTOs/executives see "ninochavez.pro" and interpret "professional consultant"
- **Photography:** Tournament directors/athletes see "ninochavez.pro" and interpret "professional photographer"
- **Personal network:** Friends/family see your name and can explore what you do

---

### Alternative Options (Ranked):

#### 2. `ninochavez.studio` (Runner-up)
**When to choose:**
- If you plan to establish physical studio presence
- If you want to emphasize creative/architectural practice branding
- If ".studio" resonates more personally

**Tradeoffs:**
- Minor subdomain redundancy (`gallery.ninochavez.studio`)
- May imply agency rather than independent consultant
- "Studio" leans creative, may feel slightly off for pure enterprise consulting

---

#### 3. `ninochavez.co` (Safe fallback)
**When to choose:**
- If you want maximum neutrality
- If you prefer more common TLD than `.pro`
- If `.pro` feels too formal

**Tradeoffs:**
- Users will sometimes type `.com` by default (muscle memory)
- No semantic signal about what you do (just your name)
- Acceptable but less distinctive than `.pro`

---

#### 4. `ninochavez.io` (Tech-focused fallback)
**When to choose:**
- If your enterprise work is heavily tech/startup focused
- If you want to signal innovation/tech-forward thinking
- If you prefer most familiar alternative TLD

**Tradeoffs:**
- May signal "tech startup" rather than "seasoned enterprise architect"
- At 25 years experience with $25M projects, `.io` may underposition you
- Photography audience may find `.io` confusing

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Domain Registration
- Register `ninochavez.pro` immediately
- Consider defensive registration: `ninochavez.studio`, `ninochavez.co`, `ninochavez.io`
- Total investment: ~$60-100/year for 4 domains

### Phase 2: DNS Configuration
**Primary domain:** `ninochavez.pro`

**Subdomain architecture:**
- `ninochavez.pro` - Main portfolio site (current Svelte site)
- `cv.ninochavez.pro` - Digital CV (current `/cv` route)
- `gallery.ninochavez.pro` - Photography portfolio (future)
- `blog.ninochavez.pro` - Essays/field notes (future)

**Email setup:**
- Primary: `nino@ninochavez.pro`
- Setup: Forward to current `nino@signalx.studio` or migrate

### Phase 3: Redirects (if defensive domains registered)
- `ninochavez.studio` → `ninochavez.pro` (301 redirect)
- `ninochavez.co` → `ninochavez.pro` (301 redirect)
- `ninochavez.io` → `ninochavez.pro` (301 redirect)

### Phase 4: Brand Consistency
**Update all digital properties:**
- LinkedIn profile URL
- GitHub profile
- Business cards
- Email signatures
- Social media bios
- Google My Business (for photography)

**Timeline:** 30-45 days for full migration

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk:
- `.pro` TLD is stable and professionally recognized
- Domain passes all technical filters (email, subdomains, cognitive load)
- Your actual name ensures you never outgrow the domain

- **Mitigation:** Use direct links (business cards, email sig), not relying on users typing domain from memory

### Mitigated Risks:
- ❌ Email deliverability issues (avoided `.xyz`)
- ❌ Spam reputation (avoided `.xyz`)
- ❌ Too narrow positioning (avoided `.dev`, `.design`)
- ❌ Confusion between audiences (avoided verb-based domains like "frames" or "builds")

---
