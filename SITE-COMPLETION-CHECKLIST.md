**Action:** Create with Canva or AI (1-2 hours)

---

## ðŸ“‹ MISSING: Optional Enhancement Pages

### 1. Services Page (`/services`) - OPTIONAL
**Purpose:** Dedicated page for what you offer

**Why add it:**
- Clear call-to-action for consulting inquiries
- Separate enterprise vs photography offerings
- Good for "Nino Chavez services" searches

**Structure:**
```
/services
â”œâ”€â”€ Enterprise Consulting
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AI Transformation Strategy
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Enterprise Architecture Advisory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cloud Migration Planning
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Technical Due Diligence
â””â”€â”€ Photography Services
    â”œâ”€â”€ Tournament Photography
    â”œâ”€â”€ Action Sports Coverage
    â””â”€â”€ Team Photography
```

**Priority:** LOW (already covered in /about and homepage)

**Purpose:** Detailed project breakdowns

**Why add it:**

```

**Priority:** MEDIUM (good for SEO, but can wait)

---

### 3. Contact Page (`/contact`) - OPTIONAL
**Purpose:** Dedicated contact form

**Why skip it:**
- Contact already on homepage (Portfolio section)

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tailwind
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Vercel, AWS, Docker
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ VS Code, Claude Code, Git
â””â”€â”€ Photography
    â”œâ”€â”€ Camera: Sony A7 IV
    â”œâ”€â”€ Lenses: 70-200mm f/2.8, 24-70mm f/2.8
