# Copy Assessment: Project Work Rows
**Role:** Copy Editor & Copywriter  
**Date:** 2025  
**Focus:** Titles, Subtitles, and Descriptions

---

## Overall Assessment

### Strengths

- **Specificity**: Strong use of concrete numbers and metrics
- **Consistency**: Similar structure across projects aids scanning

### Areas for Improvement
- **Value proposition clarity**: Some descriptions lead with technical details instead of outcomes
- **Title impact**: Some titles are descriptive but lack punch
- **Tone variation**: Mix of casual and formal voices creates inconsistency
- **Accessibility**: Some copy assumes technical knowledge without providing context

## Project-by-Project Analysis

### 1. AI‑Native Portfolio Experience
**Title:** `AI‑Native Portfolio Experience`  
**Subtitle:** `This site — SvelteKit + multi‑agent workflow`

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Title is clear and descriptive
- ⚠️ Subtitle feels casual/incomplete ("This site" is vague without context)
- ⚠️ Description starts with technical jargon ("orchestrating specialized agents") before explaining value

**Recommendations:**
- **Subtitle:** "Production portfolio built with SvelteKit and AI‑accelerated workflows"
- **Description rewrite:** Lead with the outcome, then the how:
  - "A production-grade portfolio showcasing AI-native development workflows. Built with SvelteKit, featuring centralized copy management, lazy-loaded sections, EXIF-aware portfolio modals, and automated Playwright audits for visual QA and accessibility."

**Assessment:**

### 4. Commerce Transformation Navigator
**Title:** `Commerce Transformation Navigator`  
**Subtitle:** `Multi-mode strategic capability explorer for consultants`

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Title is descriptive and professional

Maps 567 capabilities across 10 domains, featuring 52 personas, 193 orchestrator agents, and interactive architecture diagrams.

### 5. AI Agent Development Governance
**Title:** `AI Agent Development Governance`  
**Subtitle:** `Constitutional governance for AI agent code`

**Assessment:**
- ⚠️ Title is generic and lacks differentiation
- ⚠️ "Constitutional governance" is clever but may be too abstract for scanning
- ✅ Description is concise but lacks impact

**Recommendations:**
- **Title:** `Aegis — AI Agent Development Governance`
- **Subtitle:** "Framework for consistent, compliant AI-generated code"
- **Description:** Add more outcome-focused language:

---

### 6. AI‑Velocity Enterprise App (72h)
**Title:** `AI‑Velocity Enterprise App (72h)`  
**Subtitle:** `SmugMug API reference application`

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Title highlights the impressive achievement (72h)
- ⚠️ "AI‑Velocity" feels like internal jargon; may not resonate with all audiences
- ⚠️ Subtitle undersells the achievement
- ✅ Description is concise and outcome-focused

**Recommendations:**
- **Title:** `Enterprise API Reference App (72h)` or `72-Hour Enterprise Integration Proof`
- **Subtitle:** "SmugMug API reference demonstrating AI-accelerated development"
- **Description:** Strengthen the proof point:
  - "Enterprise-grade reference application built solo in 72 hours using AI-agent orchestration. Demonstrates rapid development capabilities with OAuth 1.0a integration, AI-powered photo search, bulk operations, and comprehensive documentation. A practical proof of AI-accelerated enterprise development velocity."

### 7. AI Studio Commerce App
**Title:** `AI Studio Commerce App`  
**Subtitle:** `Prompt analysis and Gemini integration`

---

### 9. Portfolio — AI-Accelerated Photo App
**Title:** `Portfolio — AI-Accelerated Photo App`  
**Subtitle:** `Rapid photo portfolio with reference API integration`

**Assessment:**
- ⚠️ Title redundancy ("Portfolio" + "Photo App")
- ⚠️ Subtitle explains the method, not the value
- ⚠️ Description focuses on development process rather than end-user value

**Recommendations:**
- **Title:** `AI-Accelerated Photo Portfolio`
- **Subtitle:** "Modern portfolio with EXIF overlays and fast image browsing"
- **Description:** Flip to user benefits first:
  - "Modern photo portfolio featuring fast image browsing, EXIF metadata overlays, and responsive design. Built using accelerated development practices that leveraged internal reference implementations, demonstrating how strategic reuse can dramatically accelerate product delivery."

---

## Cross-Cutting Issues

### 1. Inconsistent Title Patterns
- Some use brand names (AIQ, Aegis, Agent-OS)
- Some use descriptive names (Commerce Transformation Navigator)
- Some mix both (Portfolio — AI-Accelerated Photo App)

**Recommendation:** Establish a consistent pattern:
- **Primary brand/framework:** Use branded name if available
- **Descriptive projects:** Use clear, outcome-focused titles
- **Avoid:** Dashes connecting two concepts unless necessary

### 2. Subtitle Purpose Clarity
Subtitles serve different purposes across projects:
- Technical stack (Project 1)
- Topic tags (Project 2)
- Value proposition (Project 3)
- Feature description (Project 7)

**Recommendation:** Use subtitles consistently for value proposition or audience identification.

### 3. Description Structure
Some descriptions:
- Lead with outcomes (Project 8) ✅
- Lead with technical details (Project 1) ⚠️
- Lead with features (Project 4) ⚠️

**Recommendation:** Standardize to: **Outcome → How → Technical Details**

### 4. Tone Consistency
- Mix of formal ("Enterprise SaaS platform") and casual ("This site")
- Some assume technical knowledge, others explain context

**Recommendation:** Establish a consistent voice: professional but accessible, assuming smart readers who may not be familiar with every technical term.

## Recommended Copy Principles

1. **Lead with value, not features**
2. **Use active voice** ("Delivers" not "Designed to deliver")
3. **Quantify impact** (3.5x faster, 73% savings) ✅ Already strong
4. **Explain acronyms on first use** if not universally known
5. **Use consistent terminology** (e.g., pick "AI-assisted" or "AI-accelerated" and stick with it)
6. **Keep descriptions scannable** (2-3 sentences max, break into bullets if needed)

---

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve assessment
2. Prioritize which projects to update first
3. Implement copy changes in `src/lib/constants.ts`
4. Review visual presentation to ensure copy length works with layout
