# Post-Remediation Validation Checklist

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Build Status:** ✅ Successfully built (verified)

---

## Build Verification

- [x] `pnpm install` - Dependencies installed successfully
- [x] `pnpm build` - Production build succeeds (5.62s)
- [x] `pnpm build:analyze` - Bundle analyzer configured
- [ ] `pnpm preview` - Test production build locally
- [ ] `pnpm test:e2e` - Run E2E test suite

---

## Performance Validation

### Required Actions

1. **Test Self-Hosted Fonts**
   ```bash
   pnpm preview
   # Then open DevTools Network tab
   # Verify: Inter fonts loading from /assets/ not fonts.googleapis.com
   ```

2. **Verify SSR Blog Content**
   ```bash
   # View page source (Ctrl+U or Cmd+Option+U)
   # Confirm: Blog posts visible in HTML (not loading spinner)
   ```

3. **Test Error Boundaries**
   ```bash
   # Temporarily break blog adapter to test fallback
   # Should show: "Unable to load latest posts. Showing archived content."
   ```

4. **Lighthouse Audit**
   ```bash
   pnpm preview
   # Then run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
   # Target: Performance 95+, Accessibility 100, Best Practices 100, SEO 100
   ```

5. **Verify Core Web Vitals**
   - **LCP:** Should be <1.2s (was 7.4s)
   - **CLS:** Should be <0.05 (was 0.15-0.25)
   - **FID:** Should be <100ms

## Functional Validation

### 1. Skip Links ✓
- [ ] Press Tab on page load

### 2. Lazy Loading ✓
- [ ] Scroll down the page
- [ ] Verify sections show skeleton placeholders before loading
- [ ] No jarring layout shifts

### 3. Error Recovery ✓
- [ ] Simulate blog API failure
- [ ] Should show fallback content (not crash)
- [ ] Error message should be visible

### 4. Performance Monitoring (Production Only) ✓
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Check Vercel Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Verify Web Vitals logging in production console
